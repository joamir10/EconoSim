## 💡 How It Works

The model uses a simplified formula to estimate:

- **GDP Growth** increases with more spending and lower taxes/interest.
- **Unemployment** falls with higher government spending but may rise with high taxes.
- **Inflation** rises with more spending and higher interest rates.

These are not real-world accurate but serve as an engaging learning tool.
